# Minecraft Bedrock Discord Bot

## How to
Make a file called `config.py` and add a `token="DiscordToken"` variable in there.
Launch the bot with `python3 main.py` and you're ready to go. Unless dependencies. Dependencies are google cloud and discord.

This bot was built as a fork of [celesteBot](https://github.com/CelesteClassic/celestebot), so a lot of code is recycled. 
Feel free to make a pull request or use the code here.
